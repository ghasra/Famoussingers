What are we living for\n
Abandoned places \n
I guess we know the score\n
On and on\n
Does anybody know what we are looking for...\n
Another hero another mindless crime\n
Behind the curtain in the pantomime\n
Hold the line does anybody want to take it anymore\n
The show must go on\n
The show must go on\n
Inside my heart is breaking\n
My make-up may be flaking\n
But my smile still stays on\n
Whatever happens\n
Ill leave it all to chance\n
Another heartache\n
another failed romance\n
On and on\n
does anybody know what we are living for?\n
I guess Im learning\n
I must be warmer now\n
Ill soon be turning\n
round the corner now\n
Outside the dawn is breaking\n
But inside in the dark Im aching to be free\n
The show must go on\n
The show must go on\n
Inside my heart is breaking\n
My make-up may be flaking\n
But my smile still stays on\n
My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies\n
Fairytales of yesterday will grow but never die\n
I can fly - my friends\n
The show must go on\n
The show must go on\n
Ill face it with a grin\n
Im never giving in\n
On - with the show\n
Ill top the bill Ill overkill\n
I have to find the will to carry on\n
On with the\n
On with the show\n
The show must go on\n
