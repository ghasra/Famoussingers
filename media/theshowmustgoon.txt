Empty spaces
What are we living for
Abandoned places 
I guess we know the score
On and on
Does anybody know what we are looking for...
Another hero another mindless crime
Behind the curtain in the pantomime
Hold the line does anybody want to take it anymore
The show must go on
The show must go on
Inside my heart is breaking
My make-up may be flaking
But my smile still stays on
Whatever happens
Ill leave it all to chance
Another heartache
another failed romance
On and on
does anybody know what we are living for?
I guess Im learning
I must be warmer now
Ill soon be turning
round the corner now
Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark Im aching to be free
The show must go on
The show must go on
Inside my heart is breaking
My make-up may be flaking
But my smile still stays on
My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
Fairytales of yesterday will grow but never die
I can fly - my friends
The show must go on
The show must go on
Ill face it with a grin
Im never giving in
On - with the show
Ill top the bill Ill overkill
I have to find the will to carry on
On with the
On with the show
The show must go on
